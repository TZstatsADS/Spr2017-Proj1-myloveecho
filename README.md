# Project 1: What did the presidents say at their inauguation?

My rmd file is in doc, as instructor says in class. I do not understand the point deduction. 


## Theory behind those speeches:
+ Another common distribution of user data is a “power-law,” Zipfian or Pareto distribution. That basically means that the probability of a more extreme value, z, decreases like 1/z (or 1/z^exponent). This distribution also comes up in other rare events such as the frequency of words in a text (the most common word is really really common compared to the next word on the list). These types of heavy-tailed distributions are common in internet data.
+ Historical change in political topics is reflected, such as the role of president, the power of president VS congress, the time trend of the international politics (world war, cold war, communist, etc)
+ Grammer and linguistic change, eg. length of sentence--> reflected media change?
